# Prompt #1

Compose a 2 000-word short story that simultaneously satisfies four constraints:

    Genre braid: cyberpunk noir × mythic fantasy × hard sci-fi.

    Triple perspective: first-person singular, first-person plural, and omniscient—all rotating every paragraph.

    Embedded acrostics: The first letters of paragraphs 1-10 spell a famous equation; paragraphs 11-20 encode a Shakespearean sonnet; paragraphs 21-30 form a hidden URL.

    Linguistic palette: incorporate at least five loanwords each from Japanese, Nahuatl, and Old Norse, yet remain narratively coherent.

Provide a one-paragraph “decoder’s guide” at the end explaining how to uncover the acrostics.
