# prompt #1

Build within a singular HTML file with inline javascript, a basic 3d village building game. The game should allow users to place, move, and delete blocks:
Core features:
The buildings should all be rendered with a low poly simple style
Utilize Three D rendering with any library of your choosing like for example Three.js
Implement a grid-snapping system for placing the buildings
Ensure proper object collision so buildings can only be placed when there is not a building already there
Make the code work in a modern web browser without any additional dependencies
Include multiple building styles, house, duplex, park, and more
Optimize performance to handle a complex village
Implement rotation controls for the user and a selectable menu to place the buildings

# prompt #2 (encountered error)

I can't see anything plus I cannot select any buildings. Ensure there is a terrain plane to build buildings on and 3d building objects

# prompt #3 (console error)

It is stuck on loading and outputting this error in console
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "three". Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
