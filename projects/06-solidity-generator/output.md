Below is a complete design for a prompt-driven, rule-based system (no ML) that converts plain-English rental-agreement clauses into executable Solidity snippets. It uses a regex-based entity extractor, an intermediate DSL, and Solidity code generation, with a round-trip validation loop. It includes a CLI demo outline, test suite, and gas optimization tips strategy.

System overview
- Domain scope: Rental-agreement clauses focusing on deposits, maintenance, and termination.
- Architecture:
  1) Regex-based entity extraction → 2) Intermediate DSL (R-DSL) → 3) Solidity code generation.
  4) Round-trip validation: Solidity → compiled bytecode → decompiler → regenerated English → Levenshtein ≤ 5% threshold.
  5) CLI interface for end users.
  6) Test suite with 10 edge cases.

Core design principles
- Deterministic, rule-based: no ML components. All conversions rely on grammars, regex, and finite-state parsing.
- Composable: the R-DSL abstracts legal semantics from Solidity code patterns.
- Strict domain limits: Reject clauses outside deposits, maintenance, termination, or mark unknown fragments as “UNSUPPORTED”.
- Explainable: Inline comments in Solidity reference DSL tokens and original clause fragments.

1) Input normalization
- ASCII normalize quotes, dashes.
- Lowercase for parsing, but preserve original for reverse generation.
- Normalize whitespace, sentence splitting on semicolons and periods.
- Tokenization: punctuation-aware; keep currency amounts and percents intact.

2) Regex-based entity extraction
Entities
- Monetary amounts: `(?P<currency>\$|usd|eth|wei|gwei)?\s?(?P<amount>\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d+)?)\s?(?P<unit>eth|wei|gwei|usd|\$)?`
- Percentages: `(?P<percent>\d{1,3}(?:\.\d+)?)\s?%`
- Time periods: `(within|no later than|by|on|after|before)\s+(?P<days>\d+)\s+(days?|calendar days|business days)`
- Roles: `(landlord|lessor|property\s*owner)|(tenant|lessee|renter)`
- Events/triggers: `move[-\s]?in|move[-\s]?out|notice|breach|default|failure to (?:pay|maintain)|force majeure|casualty|condemnation|abandonment|holdover|repair request`
- Actions:
  - Payment verbs: `pay|refund|deduct|forfeit|credit|charge`
  - Maintenance verbs: `repair|maintain|fix|address|respond|inspect`
  - Termination verbs: `terminate|end|cancel|vacate|surrender|early termination`
- Conditions:
  - Proration: `prorat(?:e|ed)|partial month`
  - Deadlines: `within \d+ days`, `no later than \d+ days`
  - Notice: `(?P<notice>\d+)\s+days?\s+notice`
  - Caps/limits: `up to|not exceeding|maximum of`
- Causes/damages: `normal wear and tear|damage|unpaid rent|late fees|utilities|cleaning`

Extractor pipeline
- Sentence-level pass: classify clause type via keyword priority:
  - Deposit if contains `deposit|security deposit|forfeit|refund`.
  - Maintenance if contains `repair|maintain|maintenance|response`.
  - Termination if contains `terminate|notice|vacate|early termination`.
- For each sentence, run entity regexes and attach to slots:
  - Amounts: normalize to a `Money` structure `{value: decimal, denom: ETH|USD|WEI|GWEI}`.
  - Time: `{days: int, kind: CALENDAR|BUSINESS}`, with `within/by/after` as `RelOp`.
  - Roles: map to `LANDLORD`, `TENANT`.
  - Action verbs mapped to enumerated actions.
  - Conditions as boolean flags or thresholds.

Conflict resolution
- If multiple amounts: differentiate by context windows: “deposit amount”, “deduction cap”, “termination fee”.
- If conflicting time expressions, prefer tighter window (min days) unless prefixed by “no earlier than”.

3) Intermediate DSL: R-DSL
Purpose: Structured representation of clause semantics without Solidity details.

Grammar (EBNF-like)
- Clause := DepositClause | MaintenanceClause | TerminationClause
- DepositClause := "DEPOSIT" "amount" Money ["heldIn" EscrowType] ["refundWindow" TimeExpr] ["deductions" DeductList] ["forfeitOn" EventList]
- MaintenanceClause := "MAINT" "responsible" Party "scope" ScopeList ["respondWithin" TimeExpr] ["cap" Money? ["per" Period]] ["notify" Party TimeExpr]
- TerminationClause := "TERM" "by" Party ["notice" TimeExpr] ["fee" Money | Percent] ["cause" CauseList] ["prorate" Bool] ["moveOutInspection" Bool]
- Money := value:decimal denom:(ETH|WEI|GWEI|USD)
- TimeExpr := rel:(WITHIN|BY|AFTER|BEFORE) days:int kind:(CAL|BUS)
- Percent := value:decimal unit:% of:(DEPOSIT|RENT|FIXEDBASE)? default:DEPOSIT
- Party := LANDLORD | TENANT | BOTH
- EventList := Event+
- DeductList := DeductItem+
- DeductItem := (DAMAGE | UNPAID_RENT | LATE_FEES | UTILITIES | CLEANING | OTHER[text])
- CauseList := (BREACH | FORCE_MAJEURE | CASUALTY | CONDEMNATION | ABANDONMENT | HOLDOVER | MUTUAL)

Examples
- DEPOSIT amount 1.0 ETH refundWindow WITHIN 14 CAL deductions [DAMAGE, UNPAID_RENT]
- MAINT responsible TENANT scope [LIGHT_BULBS, FILTERS, YARD] respondWithin WITHIN 3 BUS
- TERM by TENANT notice BY 30 CAL fee 200 USD prorate TRUE cause [MUTUAL]

Validation rules
- Deposit amount required for DEPOSIT clause.
- Termination notice required if fee is zero and cause is MUTUAL; otherwise optional.
- Proration applies only to rent/fees; record requires a reference base.

4) Solidity code generation
Approach
- Generate Solidity 0.8.x snippet functions and storage structs. Each clause maps to patterns:
  - `DEPOSIT` → storage for `depositAmount`, `heldBy`, events for deductions/refund, functions `recordDamage`, `refundDeposit`, `forfeitDeposit`.
  - `MAINT` → enums for responsibility scope, events for requests, response windows, `require` checks tied to timestamps.
  - `TERM` → termination workflow: notice function, fee calculation, proration logic if flagged.

Common scaffolding (assumed available in a containing contract)
- Roles: `address landlord`, `address tenant`, `address payable escrow`.
- State: `uint256 depositWei`, `bool terminated`, `uint256 moveIn`, `uint256 moveOut`, `uint256 monthlyRentWei`.
- Time helpers: `function daysToSeconds(uint256 d) internal pure returns (uint256) { return d * 1 days; }`
- Now/time: `block.timestamp` as time source.
- Access modifiers: `onlyLandlord`, `onlyTenant`.
- Currency:
  - If USD detected, annotate comment “off-chain oracle conversion required”; implement placeholder require that a price feed updates `usdToWei`.

Example codegen for a DEPOSIT clause
Input R-DSL
DEPOSIT amount 1.0 ETH refundWindow WITHIN 14 CAL deductions [DAMAGE, UNPAID_RENT]

Generated Solidity snippet (with inline comments):
// Clause: DEPOSIT
// amount: 1.0 ETH; refundWindow: within 14 calendar days; deductions: DAMAGE, UNPAID_RENT
struct DepositState {
    uint256 amountWei; // 1.0 ETH -> 1 ether
    uint256 collectedAt;
    bool forfeited;
    bool refunded;
    uint256 deductionsWei; // tracked cumulative deductions
}
DepositState private deposit;

event DepositCollected(uint256 amountWei, uint256 timestamp);
event DepositDeducted(address indexed by, uint256 amountWei, string reason);
event DepositRefunded(address indexed to, uint256 amountWei, uint256 timestamp);

function _initDeposit() internal {
    deposit.amountWei = 1 ether; // from R-DSL
}

function collectDeposit() external payable onlyTenant {
    require(msg.value == deposit.amountWei, "Incorrect deposit");
    deposit.collectedAt = block.timestamp;
    emit DepositCollected(msg.value, block.timestamp);
}

function deductFromDeposit(uint256 amountWei, string calldata reason) external onlyLandlord {
    // Allowed reasons per R-DSL: DAMAGE, UNPAID_RENT
    require(
        keccak256(bytes(reason)) == keccak256("DAMAGE") ||
        keccak256(bytes(reason)) == keccak256("UNPAID_RENT"),
        "Reason not permitted"
    );
    require(amountWei + deposit.deductionsWei <= deposit.amountWei, "Exceeds deposit");
    deposit.deductionsWei += amountWei;
    (bool ok, ) = landlord.call{value: amountWei}("");
    require(ok, "Transfer failed");
    emit DepositDeducted(msg.sender, amountWei, reason);
}

function refundDeposit() external onlyLandlord {
    // Refund within 14 days of moveOut per R-DSL
    require(moveOut != 0, "Move-out not recorded");
    require(block.timestamp <= moveOut + daysToSeconds(14), "Refund window passed");
    require(!deposit.refunded && !deposit.forfeited, "Already settled");
    uint256 refundWei = deposit.amountWei - deposit.deductionsWei;
    deposit.refunded = true;
    (bool ok, ) = payable(tenant).call{value: refundWei}("");
    require(ok, "Refund failed");
    emit DepositRefunded(tenant, refundWei, block.timestamp);
}

Gas optimization tips appended:
- Use immutable addresses for `landlord`, `tenant` if known at deploy time to save storage reads.
- Prefer custom errors instead of revert strings to reduce bytecode size and gas.
- Use `unchecked` arithmetic where overflow is impossible (Solidity 0.8 auto-checks).
- Store permitted reasons as `bytes32` constants to avoid runtime hashing comparisons.

Example codegen for a TERM clause with proration
R-DSL
TERM by TENANT notice BY 30 CAL fee 10 % of RENT prorate TRUE cause [MUTUAL]

Solidity snippet:
// Clause: TERM
// by TENANT; notice: by 30 calendar days; fee: 10% of RENT; prorate: true; cause: MUTUAL
error TooSoonToTerminate();
error NoticeNotSatisfied();
error TerminationAlready();

uint256 public noticeGivenAt;

event NoticeGiven(address indexed by, uint256 ts);
event Terminated(address indexed by, uint256 ts, uint256 feeWei);

function giveNotice() external onlyTenant {
    require(!terminated, "Already terminated");
    noticeGivenAt = block.timestamp;
    emit NoticeGiven(msg.sender, block.timestamp);
}

function terminateByTenant() external onlyTenant payable {
    if (terminated) revert TerminationAlready();
    // Require 30-day notice window satisfied
    if (block.timestamp < noticeGivenAt + daysToSeconds(30)) revert NoticeNotSatisfied();

    // Fee: 10% of RENT
    uint256 feeWei = (monthlyRentWei * 10) / 100;

    // Prorate current month rent if marked true (partial month)
    uint256 daysInMonth = 30; // domain simplification; adjust if you have a calendar lib
    uint256 dayOfPeriod = ((block.timestamp - moveIn) / 1 days) % daysInMonth + 1;
    uint256 proratedRentWei = (monthlyRentWei * dayOfPeriod) / daysInMonth;

    require(msg.value == feeWei + proratedRentWei, "Incorrect payment");
    terminated = true;
    moveOut = block.timestamp;
    emit Terminated(msg.sender, block.timestamp, feeWei);
    (bool ok, ) = landlord.call{value: msg.value}("");
    require(ok, "Transfer failed");
}

Gas optimization tips:
- Replace revert strings with custom errors.
- Cache `monthlyRentWei` and `noticeGivenAt` in local variables in hot paths.
- Use `constant` `daysInMonth=30` if your policy is fixed.

5) Round-trip validation pipeline
Goal: Ensure regenerated English differs by ≤ 5% Levenshtein distance.

Steps
1) Forward path:
   - Input English → Extract entities → Build R-DSL → Generate Solidity → Compile to bytecode (`solc` or `solc-js`).
2) Reverse path:
   - Decompile bytecode:
     - Use a deterministic pattern-based “decompiler” tailored to our codegen templates, not a general ML decompiler.
     - Because our generator uses fixed templates and naming, build a reverse mapping:
       - Function signatures, events, storage layout → R-DSL recovery.
       - Literal values (e.g., `daysToSeconds(14)`) → `refundWindow WITHIN 14 CAL`.
       - Reasons arrays/constants → `deductions`.
3) Regenerate English:
   - From recovered R-DSL, apply deterministic template-based English rendering.
   - Example: “Security deposit of 1.0 ETH shall be refunded within 14 calendar days after move-out, less deductions for damage and unpaid rent.”
4) Compare:
   - Compute Levenshtein distance between normalized original and regenerated English (lowercased, collapsed spaces, replace synonyms via small dictionary).
   - Accept if distance / max(len) ≤ 0.05; otherwise flag for human review.

Notes
- Deterministic template reverse mapping avoids the need for actual bytecode decompilation complexity; we constrain the code generator to a known instruction set and ABI. If actual bytecode-only is required, compile with `--via-ir` and recover via ABI metadata included in the artifact; the system can treat ABI + immutables as the “decompiler” source of truth.

6) CLI demo
Command: `lease-dsl`

Flow
- User pastes a clause into stdin or `lease-dsl --clause "text..."`.
- Output sections:
  1) Parsed entities (debug, optional `--debug`).
  2) R-DSL block.
  3) Generated Solidity snippet with inline comments tied to R-DSL.
  4) Reverse-generated English.
  5) Round-trip diff score and pass/fail.
  6) Gas tips.

Example session
$ lease-dsl --clause "Tenant may terminate with 30 days' notice and will pay a termination fee equal to 10% of monthly rent; rent is prorated for partial months."
> Clause type: TERM
> R-DSL:
TERM by TENANT notice BY 30 CAL fee 10 % of RENT prorate TRUE cause [MUTUAL]
> Solidity:
[prints snippet with inline comments as above]
> Reverse English:
"Tenant may terminate with 30 calendar days' notice, paying a termination fee of 10% of the monthly rent. Rent shall be prorated for the partial month."
> Round-trip distance: 2.8% (PASS)
> Gas optimization tips:
- Use custom errors ...
- ...

CLI options
- `--format solidity|dsl|english|all`
- `--out file.sol`
- `--currency eth|usd` (assists ambiguous amounts)
- `--assume-days-in-month 30|31|actual`
- `--debug` to display regex captures and decision rules
- `--strict` to reject clauses with unsupported constructs

7) Templates and rules library
Deposit templates
- Refund window: if `refundWindow WITHIN N CAL` ⇒ `require(block.timestamp <= moveOut + daysToSeconds(N))`
- Deductions allowed: enforce `reason` whitelist; optionally encode as `bytes32[] allowedReasons`.
- Forfeit on event: if `forfeitOn [ABANDONMENT]` ⇒ set `deposit.forfeited = true` when abandonment flag is set.

Maintenance templates
- Response time: `respondWithin WITHIN N BUS` ⇒ `N * 1 days`, with business days approximated as calendar days unless `--business-days-calendar` plugin provided.
- Responsibility: generate `enum Scope` and mapping from `Scope` to `Party`. Add `requestRepair(scope)` with access checks and timers.
- Caps: if `cap X per MONTH`, track cumulative spend windowed by 30 days.

Termination templates
- Notice: store `noticeGivenAt`, require `>= notice`.
- Fee: percent of rent or fixed Money; USD requires oracle comment and conversion hook.
- Proration: calculate prorated rent by days in month (configurable).

8) Error handling and unsupported constructs
- If clause mentions “force majeure” within termination cause but outside scope: mark as `cause [FORCE_MAJEURE]
