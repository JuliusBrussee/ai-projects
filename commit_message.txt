feat: Add new projects and refactor repository structure

This commit adds several new LLM stress test projects and significantly refactors the repository's organization for better clarity and scalability.

### New Projects Added:
- **Music Synthesizer:** A prompt to generate a piano-roll UI with live music generation via a WASM-ported WaveNet.
- **Time-Travel Dashboard:** A prompt for a 3D interactive data dashboard visualizing historical data.
- **Poetry Generator:** A complex prompt for a short story with multiple stylistic and structural constraints.
- **Solidity Generator:** A prompt to create a rule-based system for generating Solidity smart contracts from plain English.

### Refactoring and Enhancements:
- **Standardized Project Structure:**
  - Implemented a consistent `output/` subdirectory for generated files.
  - Added a `metadata.json` file to each project for structured data.
  - Renamed project directories for brevity and consistency.
- **Enhanced README.md:**
  - Converted the project list into a detailed table with descriptions, tags, and demo links.
  - Added a Table of Contents, License section, and a more prominent Disclaimer.
- **Project Scaffolding Script:**
  - Added `create_project.sh` to automate the creation of new projects with the standard structure.
