# LLM Stress Tests: Pushing the Boundaries of AI Code Generation

This repository is dedicated to exploring and stress-testing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, particularly focusing on what they can achieve with minimal, concise, and sometimes ambiguous input.

## Mission

The core idea is to provide an LLM with a high-level concept or a set of core feature requests and observe its ability to:

*   Translate abstract requirements into functional code.
*   Select appropriate libraries and technologies (when not specified).
*   Implement complex logic and interactions.
*   Structure code for readability and maintainability (to varying degrees).
*   Handle implicit requirements and make reasonable assumptions.
*   Generate complete, runnable applications within given constraints (e.g., a single file).

## Why Stress Test?

*   **Understand Capabilities:** To gain a deeper understanding of current LLM strengths and weaknesses in practical software development scenarios.
*   **Identify Limits:** To find the "breaking points" where LLMs struggle or fail, providing insights into areas needing further research and development.
*   **Improve Prompt Engineering:** To learn how to formulate prompts more effectively to guide LLMs towards desired outcomes, especially for complex tasks.
*   **Showcase Potential:** To demonstrate the impressive potential of LLMs as tools for rapid prototyping, learning, and even production-level assistance.

## Projects

This repository will house various projects, each initiated with a relatively simple prompt given to an LLM. Each project will include:

*   The original prompt(s) given to the LLM.
*   The generated code.
*   A project-specific README detailing the experience, observations, and any manual interventions required.
*   (Where applicable) A `PROMPT_HISTORY.md` or similar, documenting the iterative prompting process if multiple steps were involved.

### Current Projects:

*   **[Basic 3D Village Builder](./projects/01-3D-Village-Builder/README.md):** A single HTML file game using Three.js, generated from a request for a simple 3D village building experience with specific core features.
*   *   **[Basic 3D Wealth Disparity Display](./projects/03-Wealthy-Disparity-Visualizer/README.md):** A single HTML file using Three.js, generated from a request for a simple 3D display meant to display the wealth disparity in America using calculated block heights.

## How to Interpret Results

The projects here are not necessarily examples of "best practices" in software engineering if a human were solely responsible. Instead, they are a reflection of the LLM's interpretation and execution based on the input provided. Manual clean-up or refinements by a human developer might be noted, but the initial output from the LLM is the primary focus.

## Contributing

While the primary goal is to document LLM-generated projects based on specific prompts, suggestions for new stress-test project ideas are welcome! Please open an issue to discuss your idea.

If you replicate a project or try a similar prompt with a different LLM, feel free to share your results and observations.

## Disclaimer

The code generated by LLMs and hosted in this repository is for experimental and educational purposes. It may contain bugs, inefficiencies, or security vulnerabilities. Always review and test AI-generated code thoroughly before using it in critical applications.
